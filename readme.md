# Randey

Randey is Real Time renderer built for education reasons only. I am not doing it to make a game or to try and compete with bigger rendering framework.

Hence, if you are looking for a good codebase, [looks elsewhere](https://github.com/topics/game-engine).

## Features

- tiny_obj_loader model loading;
- Deferred rendering;
- Shadow Mapping;
- Point and Directional lights;

## Roadmap

- UI;
- Physically Based Rendering;
- Post Processing;
- Cascaded Shadow Mapping;
- Clustered Deferred Rendering;
- Porting to DX12/Vulkan;
- Hybrid Rendering with ray traced shadows and reflection (using HW ray tracing);
- Scene Description file;
